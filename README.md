# What's MASShortcut?

Some time ago Cocoa developers used a brilliant framework [ShortcutRecorder](http://wafflesoftware.net/shortcut/) for managing keyboard shortcuts in application preferences. However, it became incompatible with a new plugin architecture of Xcode 4. All code is compatible with Xcode 4.3 (and later), Mac OS X 10.7 (and later) and the sandboxed environment.


# Why MASShortcut?

The project MASShortcut introduces modern API and user interface for recording, storing and using global keyboard shortcuts.

> There is a lot of menu bar apps which display a panel with user interface when you click the menu bar icon. To make our life easier, these apps usually provide a global keyboard shortcut to access that panel without using your mouse.

> Other apps just run in background and wait while you press a hotkey to perform some action. Evernote, Fantastical, Clocks, LittleSnapper, Thingsâ€¦ all of these use global shortcuts to do their work. But how to implement this feature in you own Mac app?

> Unfortunately, there is no official Cocoa API like NSGlobalShortcut. Instead, you have to deal with old low-level Carbon APIs to listen for global hotkeys, look [here](http://cocoasamurai.blogspot.jp/2009/03/global-keyboard-shortcuts-with-carbon.html) and [here](http://cocoatutorial.grapewave.com/2010/01/adding-a-hotkey-listener/) to find more details.

> In addition, we would need a control like NSGlobalShortcutView to enter and display keyboard shortcuts with special characters for Command, Option and Shift, something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8201338/how-to-implement-shortcut-key-input-in-mac-cocoa-app/8204355#8204355).

> From the links I just posted, you may find that adding support for global keyboard shortcuts is a non-trivial task. You have to dive into the component architecture, copy many sources or framework into your project, and finally add many lines of code into your app.


# Usage

I hope, it is really easy:
```objective-c
// Drop a custom view into XIB and set its class to MASShortcutView
@property ( nonatomic, weak ) IBOutlet MASShortcutView* shortcutView;
	
// Think up a preference key to store a global shortcut between launches
NSString* const kPreferenceGlobalShortcut = @"GlobalShortcut";

// Assign the preference key and the shortcut view will take care of persistence
self.shortcutView.associatedUserDefaultsKey = kPreferenceGlobalShortcut;

// Execute your block of code automatically when user triggers a shortcut from preferences
[ MASShortcut registerGlobalShortcutWithUserDefaultsKey: kPreferenceGlobalShortcut 
                                                handler:
    ^{
     /* Let me know if you find a better or more convenient API. */
    } ];
```

To set an example, I made a demo project: [MASShortcutDemo](https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcutDemo). Enjoy!
